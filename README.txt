I have made a Grocery Store Management System using the basic concepts of File Handling, Structures, Arrays, etc.
I have used two datastructures viz. QUEUE and LINKED LIST for some purposes.
My program focuses on some basic problems faced by Grocery store /
This Program will store the details of items in an inventory, operate on them, modify them, search for them.
This program will store details of customer, keep records and make bills.
